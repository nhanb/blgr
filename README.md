Experimental desktop blogging software that aims to

- Be self-contained:
  + single executable that launches a web-based composing UI ala wordpress
    (markdown, not wysiwyg)
  + but backed by a simple SQLite file
- Be friendly to not-computer-people:
  + one-click deploy to e.g. GitHub/GitLab/BitBucket Pages. (see: [lektor][1])
  + offer a hosted solution, in which case it's indistinguishable from a hosted
    wordpress.com site. Should allow exporting the whole thing to be usable
    with the desktop tool of course.

None of which has been implemented tho.
